# 125-Ciceksepeti-React-Bootcamp

This project uses the following technologies:

* React
* SCSS (through node-sass package)
* React-Redux
* Redux-Saga
* React-router-dom  
* Axios

Click here for a [live demo](https://125-ciceksepeti-ogunakar-final.vercel.app/).

## How it works:

* All the styling is applied through SCSS. 
* All API calls are made through Axios. 
* Create products and profile pages are private routes for users only.  
* Products, product categories, colors, brands, statuses are saved onto redux storage on load.
* Category navbar uses query params and useLocation to redirect to a particular category with filtered cards.   
* User authorization token is saved into local storage.
* Every time a user visits, check user login saga is called. If a token exists in local storage, it gets saved into redux store. Should any calls on behalf of the user be made, a bearer token is attached automatically.
* If a particular card is clicked, another API call is made with its id to fetch its details for the product-detail page.
* Profile page displays given and received offers.   

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
